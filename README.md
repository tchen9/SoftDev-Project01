## Instructions

### Setup
Run the db_tool script to create a sqlite3 database.
```
$ python db_tool.py
```
This will automatically generate some test stories that can be used for demo purposes.

### Running
In the terminal, run the app.py script.
```
$ python app.py
```

In a web browser, go to ```localhost:5000``` to access the web app.

Login to view, create, and contribute to stories.

Have fun!

## Things to Note
 - While this web app works if only one user is contributing to a story at a time, it could be helpful to implement a lock feature that prevents other users from editing a story while a user is already editing it.
